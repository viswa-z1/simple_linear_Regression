Simple Linear Regression using Sci-kit Learn to predict the emission of co2 level


REGRESSION :
        Regression is a method of modelling a target value based on independent predictors. This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out cause and effect relationship between variables. Regression techniques mostly differ based on the number of independent variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. Based on the given data points, we try to plot a line that models the points the best.
